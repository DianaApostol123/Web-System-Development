    <h2 id="abstract" style="color: #5e9ca0">1. Abstract</h2>


    <article style="line-height: 30px; margin-right: 50px">
      <p>The following lines are supposed to describe the way of how the application works. The rows below describes the
        main flows of the application as follows:</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="introduction" style="color: #5e9ca0">2. Introduction</h2>
      <article style="line-height: 30px; margin-right: 50px">
        <p>The application is a web system able to properly assist a museum visitor. Basically,
          in order to have access to the museum's tour, user is invited to scan his ticket which contains a QR code.
          Once the QR code is scanned, user has access to the application which provides information about the
          respective museum and its objects of culture. When the user stops in front of an object from the museum, the
          virtual tour also is interrupted until the user goes ahead.
          The application provides two languages for the user: romanian and english languages. Based on his preferences,
          user can set the language and the application will be translated.</p>
        <br>



        <h2 id="structure" style="color: #5e9ca0">3. Structure</h2>
        <p>The application contains 6 pages: Virtual tour, Photo album, Information, Contact,
          Review and Help & Support. Each page is detailed in the following rows.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2e6c80" id="virtual-tour">3.1. Virtual Tour Page</h2>
        <img src="../scholarlyHTML-application/images/virtual_tour.png"; style="width:700px; height:500px">


        <p>This page will contain a section for scanning the QR code. In order for the tour to
          start, scanning of the QR code from the ticket must be done. After this, the tour will start. This will
          consist of an interactive experience. The video and audio will have a common start. After that, depending on
          what area you are in the museum, the presentation will change accordingly.
          In order for the app to know the user positioning, the RFID technology will be used. There will be for each
          area of the museum an RFID transmitor. The app will read the data from the RFID and will show to the user the
          informations from that section.
          The presentation can be paused when needed, otherwise will contain at it's normal speed. There is also a
          button that will allow to activate the camera in order to take pictures. At this moment the tour will stop. After the
          picture is taken, the user can access the button "Back" and the tour will contain.
          At the end the tour cannot be reloaded. The beginning page in which you can scan a new QR will appear. When

      <h2 style="color: #5e9ca0" id="qr-code">4. QR code</h2>
      <p>The QR code will be done using The METAQRCODE API, which provides developers a way to
        create their own XML metadata and put it inside a QRCode.
        This API is Rest based, and can be consumed using JSON or XML. We used this because it is a Single purpose API. It is easier to develop
        and because of the popularity of the tool, the support is more easy to find.</p>

      <h2 style="color: #5e9ca0" id="data">5. Data</h2>
      <p>The informations will be taken from the site <a
          href="http://data.gov.ro/dataset/ghidul-muzeelor-din-romania" style="color: #0000EE">data about Romanian museums</a> and <a
          href="http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/" style="color: #0000EE">Muzee si Colectii din Romania</a>. The data will be stored in our
        database, a Postgres Sql Database.
        We will use API to take the data from there into our application. </p>

      <h2 style="color: #5e9ca0" id="instant-translate">6. Instant Translate</h2>
      <p>For the Review page we will use a bot that will translate all the text. <a
          href="https://thereisabotforthat.com/bots/insttranslatebot" style="color: #0000EE">The Instant Bot </a> can translate anything
        between 104 languages. This will
        increase the users interaction. If the user doesn't speak the language of another user, there is a button Translate which will display a pop up in order for
        the user to choose the desired language.
        After that the bot will change the text to that language. This will happen only for this user, the text will
        remain the same for the others. </p>
