<p>The application is a web system able to properly assist a museum visitor.</p>
<p></p>

<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">Design of the application</h1>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Virtual Tour Page</h2>

<p>This page will contain a section for scanning the QR code. In order for the tour to start, scanning of the QR code from the ticket must be done. After this, the tour will start. This will consist of an interactive experience. The video and audio will have a common start. After that, depending on what area you are in the museum, the presentation will change accordingly.</p>
<p>In order for the app to know the user positioning, the RFID technology will be used. There will be for each area of the museum an RFID transmitor. The app will read the data from the RFID and will show to the user the informations from that section.</p>
<p>The presentation can be paused when needed, otherwise will contain at it's normal speed. There is also a button that will allow to activate the camera in order to take pictures. At this moment the tour will stop. After the picture is taken, the user can access the button "Back" and the tour will contain.</p>
<p>At the end the tour can be reloaded. Also a button "Scan QR" will redirect you to the begening page in which you can scan a new QR.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Photo Album Page</h2>

<p>Here the user will find all the pictures that he tooked during the tour. He also has multiple options for share on social media on which he can select.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Information Page</h2>

<p>The page Information contains all the exhibits that were in the museum with a breif description so that the user can access easily. In this way he doesn't have to access all the virtual tour again.</p>
<p>After a new museum is visitated, a new option for selecting the new museum will be added. The new exhibits will be added here too.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Reviews Page</h2>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Help&Support Page</h2>

<p>The page Help comes with a few instructions of using the application.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Contact Page</h2>
  
<p>The data use is taken from the database, from the database of <a href="http://data.gov.ro/dataset/ghidul-muzeelor-din-romania"> the site</a> from RFID</p>

<section>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">QR code</h2>
<p>The QR code will be done using The METAQRCODE API, which provides developers a way to create their own XML metadata and put it inside a QRCode. 
This API is Rest based, and can be consumed using JSON or XML.</p>
<p>We used this because it is a Single purpose API. It is easier to develop and because of the popularity of the tool, the support is more easy to find.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Data</h2>
<p>The informations will be taken from the site <a href="http://data.gov.ro/dataset/ghidul-muzeelor-din-romania">data about Romanian museums</a> and <a href="http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/">Muzee si Colectii din Romania</a>. The data will be stored in our database, a Postgres Sql Database.
 We will use API to take the data from there into our application. </p>
 
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Instant Translate</h2>
 <p>For the Review page we will use a bot that will translate all the text. <a href="https://thereisabotforthat.com/bots/insttranslatebot">The Instant Bot  </a> can translate anything between 104 languages. This will 
increase the users interaction. If the user doesn't speak the language of another user, there is  a button Translate which will display a pop up in order for the user to choose the desired language.
After that the bot will change the text to that language. This will happen only for this user, the text will remain the same for the others. </p>
