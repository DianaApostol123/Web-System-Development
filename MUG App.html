<p style="margin-left:100px">The application is a web system able to properly assist a museum visitor. Basically, in order to have access to the museum's tour, user is invited to scan his ticket which contains a QR code.
Once the QR code is</p><p style="margin-left:50px"> scanned, user has access to the application which provides information about the respective museum and its objects of culture. When the user stops in front of an object from the museum, the virtual tour also is interrupted until the user goes ahead. 
 The application provides two languages for the user: romanian and english languages.Based on his preferences, user can set the language and the application will be translated.</p>

<h2 style="color: #7a9199; margin-left:50px"; id = "qr-code">QR code</h2>
<p style="margin-left:100px">The QR code will be done using The METAQRCODE API, which provides developers a way to create their own XML metadata and put it inside a QRCode. 
This API is Rest based, and can be consumed using</p><p style="margin-left:50px"> JSON or XML. We used this because it is a Single purpose API. It is easier to develop and because of the popularity of the tool, the support is more easy to find.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; margin-left:50px"; id="data">Data</h2>
<p style="margin-left:100px">The informations will be taken from the site <a href="http://data.gov.ro/dataset/ghidul-muzeelor-din-romania">data about Romanian museums</a> and <a href="http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/">Muzee si Colectii din Romania</a>. The data will be stored in our database, a Postgres Sql Database.
 We will use API to take the data</p><p style="margin-left:50px"> from there into our application. </p>
 
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; margin-left:50px"; id = "instant-translate">Instant Translate</h2>
<p style="margin-left:100px">For the Review page we will use a bot that will translate all the text. <a href="https://thereisabotforthat.com/bots/insttranslatebot">The Instant Bot  </a> can translate anything between 104 languages. This will 
increase the users interaction. If the user doesn't speak the language</p><p style="margin-left:50px"> of another user, there is  a button Translate which will display a pop up in order for the user to choose the desired language.
After that the bot will change the text to that language. This will happen only for this user, the text will remain the same for the others. </p>
